    // Treatment Tips
    <string name="preventive_tips_a">●	Stay home. Do not go to public places.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_b">●	Drink fluids. You lose more water when you are sick. Dehydration can make symptoms worse and cause other health problems.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_c">●	Monitor. If your symptoms get worse, call your doctor right away. Do not go to their office without calling first. They might tell you to stay home, or they may need to take extra steps to protect staff and other patients.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_d">●	Ask your doctor about over-the-counter medicines that may help, like acetaminophen to lower your fever.The most important thing to do is to avoid infecting other people, especially those who are over 65 or who have other health problems.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_e">●	Try to stay in one place in your home. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom if you can.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_f">●	Tell others you are sick so they keep their distance.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_g">●	Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_h">●	Wear a mask over your nose and mouth if you can.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_i">●	Wash regularly, especially your hands.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_j">●	Do not share dishes, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with anyone else.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_k">●	Clean and disinfect common surfaces like doorknobs, counters, and tabletops.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_l">●	Eat a balanced and varied diet there are no foods or supplements that can ‘boost’ our immune system and prevent or treat COVID-19. Nevertheless, eating a well-balanced diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plant and animal proteins and healthy fats is the best way to get all the essential nutrients we need for good health and normal immune function. As self-isolation may lead us to be less active, it is also important to pay close attention to food portions and to keep our energy balance adjusted to meet our need </string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_m">●	Establish a routine and practice mindful eating</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_n">●	In times of uncertainty, it is normal to feel anxious, sad, stressed and scared. Maintaining a normal daily routine can help manage some of this stress. One way we can do this is by sticking to regular mealtimes and planning meals in advance. This can help us better control hunger levels, meet our nutrient requirements and allow us to get the most out of the food we have, reducing food waste.</string>
    //food treatment
    <string name="preventive_tips_o">●	Don’t eat on the go - it’s difficult to be aware of how much you are eating. Have a seat.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_p">●	Resist eating straight from the bag/box. Serve your food – you’ll be able to see and appreciate what and how much you’re eating.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_q">●	Remove distractions. Turn off the TV and everything else with a screen, like computers, phones, etc. while eating</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_r">●	Take small bites and chew well, while focusing on the smell, taste and texture of the food. Try to get 30 chews out of each bite.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_s">●	Try putting your utensils down after each bite. Don’t pick them back up until you’ve swallowed what you already have in your mouth.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_t">●	Don’t try to finish the whole plate. If you feel full, safely keep the leftovers.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_u">●	Keeping hydrated is essential for overall health. How much water we need depends on our age, sex, weight, height, level of physical activity and environmental conditions .(i.e. hot weather will likely require you to drink more water).</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_v">●	Taking into account that around 20-30% of the water we need comes from our food, the European Food Safety Authority has set average recommendations for how much water we should drink per day depending on our age.</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_w">●	Practice safe food hygiene</string>
    <string name="preventive_tips_x">●	According to the European Food Safety Authority, there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through eating food. However, good food safety practices are important to minimise the risk of foodborne illnesses.</string>
